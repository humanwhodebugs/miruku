# ミルク (Miruku)

**ミルク** is my personal dotfiles collection, built for a lightweight, keyboard-focused workflow on Arch Linux. It’s crafted specifically for my ThinkPad X230i, optimized for performance and simplicity.

## Setup (Manual)

```
git clone https://github.com/humanwhodebugs/miruku

Run both install script.
